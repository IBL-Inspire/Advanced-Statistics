Rodenburg &amp; Dr. H.G.J. van Mil © 20202021 Universiteit Leiden Preface Every year there are several students without immediate access to the university course material. In addition, students will lose access to old course material eventually. To address these issues, as well as to improve expectation management, this online version of the entire course is being developed. You can view each days lectures, exercises, and references to the book. Contact For questions about the course structure, contents, or statistics and programming in general, please use the discussion board on Brightspace. In case of emergency or personal circumstances, you can e-mail to: Dr. H.G.J. van Mil (Advanced Statistics): h.g.j.van.mil@math.leidenuniv.nl Dr. F.J. Rodenburg (Basic Statistics): f.j.rodenburg@biology.leidenuniv.nl Due to the large number of students, during the course we only accept questions about statistics and programming through the Brightspace Q&amp;A. An exception is made for students not from Leiden University, as they often dont have access to the University systems yet. Looking for Basic Statistics? The level of difficulty and precise contents of statistics education varies from program to program. As a courtesy to students who did not obtain their BSc degree at the Institute of Biology Leiden, there is an easier version of the course that will bring you up to speed with the level of statistics expected from a third year bachelor student: Basic Statistics. If you choose to follow Basic Statistics, you will still have to complete Advanced Statistics next academic year. However, Basic Statistics assumes little to no background knowledge of statistics, mathematics, or programming. You will also be part of a smaller group of students, so there is more time for individual guidance. The first week of Basic and Advanced Statistics are identical. There is also no Brightspace page for Basic Statisticsall communication runs through the Advanced Statistics page. We will discuss the required level to consider Advanced Statistics at length, and you can still switch at any moment during the first week. This online course is a continuation of General Research Skills. The online version of the course is a work in progress. Please check back later for updates. Always consult Brightspace for the latest information on the schedule, the course material and the exam.

To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio. To minimize package installation errors, please follow this guide, even if you already have RStudio. If youre comfortable with computer software, it boils down to: Install R; Install RStudio; Open RStudio and try to knit a template R markdown file. If you cant knit to PDF, see the note below and try knitting to HTML instead. Note about TinyTeX TinyTeX is not required for this course. If you want to knit to PDF, you have to install TinyTeX. This has several advantages over HTML and Word, which are explained in the second video. For the portfolio, all you need is a working version of RStudio, and to be able to knit to HTML. Note about installation problems in general To ensure a smooth experience throughout the course, address installation issues early on. If youre following this course in the context of your biology education at Leiden University, you can always contact us, or the assistants about installation issues. Otherwise, see the general tips below, or try asking a question on Stackoverflow. Some general tips that will save you a lot of headaches with software during your education: Setting your system language to English (Windows, Mac) makes everything a lot easier to find; If you store data in Excel, setting the decimal separator to a dot (.) instead of a comma (,) will also save you a lot of extra effort; If you are on Windows, I highly recommend working on an account with administrator rights and setting user account control to Never notify.

To see the recorded lecture, click here. 3.2 Data Visualization A demonstration in RStudio by Dr. H.G.J. van Mil. 3.3 Birthday Cake An easy way to see how R works is by making plots. 3.3.1 Exercise (easy) Today is almost certainly someones birthday. Lets make them a cake! Below is an example of a simple drawing in base R: plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10), xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, las = 1, bty = &quot;n&quot;) # Level 1 ## Horizontal lines lines(c(1, 9), c(1, 1)) lines(c(1, 9), c(3, 3)) ## Vertical lines lines(c(1, 1), c(1, 3)) lines(c(9, 9), c(1, 3)) # Level 2 ## Horizontal line lines(c(2, 8), c(5, 5)) ## Vertical lines lines(c(2, 2), c(3, 5)) lines(c(8, 8), c(3, 5)) # Level 3 ## Horizontal lines lines(c(3, 7), c(7, 7)) ## Vertical lines lines(c(3, 3), c(5, 7)) lines(c(7, 7), c(5, 7)) # Candles k &lt;- 3 # number of candles x &lt;- seq(3.5, 6.5, length.out = k) # position of the candles h &lt;- 0.7 # height of the candles segments(x0 = x, x1 = x, y0 = rep(7, k), y1 = rep(7 + h, k), lwd = 3) Create a new R markdown file and copy the script to a new R chunk. Run the entire chunk using the green play button on the top right of the chunk. This will generate the figure. To see which line does what, run each line from top to bottom by clicking anywhere in the first line of code and pressing CTRL+Enter (Windows) or Command+Enter (MacOS). If this does not work, check the following: Do you have inline output disabled? Inline output may look convenient, but it usually causes more problems than it solves. Did you run the code in order?1 Now that you have seen what each line does, change the script to render 5 candles instead of 3. Can you change the code to add a layer to the cake? (You may have to make the other layers smaller, or move the candles up.) 3.3.2 Exercise (medium) Below is a video on how to read help files as a starting point for this part: Alternatively, look for explanations online. This might feel like cheating, but getting good at searching how to do things in R is actually a valuable skill. Using polygon, color your layered cake with at least three different colors. You can view the help file by typing ?polygon in the console and pressing enter. Now that everything is in place, lets add the title Happy Birthday and hide the axes. It is up to you to find out how, using whatever resource you want. 3.3.3 Exercise (hard) Now lets add sprinkling to the cake. We could tell R exactly where to draw the sprinkling, but nobody sprinkles like that. So lets make it a bit more realistic: Use the function runif to randomly draw \\(x\\)-positions for the candles from a uniform distribution. Look up how to use the function by entering ?runif in the console, or by searching online. Every time you run the script, a new set of random coordinates will be chosen for your sprinkling. To make your cake reproducible, set a seed with the set.seed function. You can search online, or in the help files how this function works, and where you should place it in your script. 3.3.4 Submission You may now draw any cake using base R functions (that means I should be able to run it without loading any additional packages). You can add comments to your code if you want, using a hashtag (#). When youre done, upload your code to Brightspace, preferably as a plaintext (.txt) file, for ease of reviewing. The top 10 cake submissions will be discussed during the lecture of tomorrow morning. The function lines adds a line to an existing plot. This is only possible if you run plot first, so run the code in order, from top to bottom.

I will ask Harald to allow embedding later. 4.2 Cake Submission Evaluation In this lecture we have a look at all your wonderful submissions. 4.3 Draw a Map of COVID-19 Cases Can you plot the number of COVID-19 infections across the world on a specific day using just plot, lines, points, text and polygon? Of course but it would probably take a very long time. If you install the following specialized packages: install.packages(&quot;COVID19&quot;) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rgeos&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rnaturalearth&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rnaturalearthdata&quot;) install.packages(&quot;sf&quot;) Here is how you could do that with ggplot2: # Load package required for easy access to COVID-19 data library(&quot;COVID19&quot;) # Load packages required for easy access to Earth data library(&quot;rnaturalearth&quot;) library(&quot;rnaturalearthdata&quot;) library(&quot;sf&quot;) # Load ggplot2 and set background to white library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) theme_set(theme_bw()) # Load Earth data from rnaturalearthdata package Earth &lt;- ne_countries(scale = &quot;medium&quot;, returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) # Load COVID-19 data for a specific date COVID19 &lt;- covid19() maxc &lt;- max(COVID19$confirmed, na.rm = TRUE) # maximum number of cases date &lt;- &quot;2021-06-30&quot; Cases &lt;- COVID19[COVID19$date == date, ] # Data cleaning countries &lt;- Cases$administrative_area_level_1 countries[countries == &quot;United States&quot;] &lt;- &quot;United States of America&quot; countries[countries == &quot;Korea, South&quot;] &lt;- &quot;South Korea&quot; countries[countries == &quot;Cote d&#39;Ivoire&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; # Match the confirmed cases to the list of countries in the Earth data wh &lt;- match(Earth$admin, countries) Earth$Cases &lt;- Cases$confirmed[wh] # Plot the data ggplot(data = Earth) + geom_sf(aes(fill = Cases)) + scale_fill_viridis_c(limits = c(0, maxc), option = &quot;plasma&quot;, trans = &quot;sqrt&quot;) + ggtitle(paste(&quot;Confirmed infections on&quot;, date)) Provided you have the latest version of R installed and the required packages were installed correctly, this will return the following: Using less than 50 lines of code, we now have a script that generates a world map colored by the number of infections on a particular day. 4.3.1 Exercises (easy) If you get stuck on any of the exercises, you can watch the video below to get unstuck. In case of installation problems, contact one of the supervisors or assistants, or work together with a student who has successfully installed the packages. Install the required packages and run the script to reproduce the figure. Look at the legend. What does 3e+07 mean? Read through the script. Can you change the figure to show the number of infections one month earlier? (Hint: Only one line in the code needs to be changed.) Delete , trans = \"sqrt\" from the script and run it again. What did this part do, and why would that be desirable? (You may restore the original script after this.) Delete the entire second to last line from the script. What did this line do? (You may restore the original script after this.) Essentially, ggplot works like this: ggplot(dataset) + whattoshow() + extraoption1() + extraoption2 + ... Add the following to the ggplot chain in the script: + coord_sf(xlim = c(-10, 35), ylim = c(35, 70)) Run the script again. What does this do? Can you change the xlim and ylim values from the previous question to center the map around Africa? Go to the github page for the viridis package. What is the point of this package? Can you change the ggplot part of our script to use a different color scheme? (Hint: We are already using one of the viridis color schemes, so you only have to change something, not add anything new.) If you click on Earth in the environment pane, or if you run View(Earth) in the console, you can see all the variables stored in the Earth data set. Can you change the original script to show the population estimates instead of the number of infections? [video explaining the entire script to be included] 4.3.2 Extra: Data Cleaning (*) If you have time left, you can try and complete the additional exercises here. The COVID-19 and Earth data sets use different names for countries. So how did I know what names to replace with what? You could simply print both lists of countries and manually look for names that are written differently in both data sets: # Country names in the Earth data set Earth$admin # Country names in the COVID-19 data set countries But these commands will return lists of over 200 countries A much easier way is to simply look at which countries were unavailable after the matching step. For example: countries &lt;- Cases$administrative_area_level_1 wh &lt;- match(Earth$admin, countries) Earth$admin[is.na(wh)] ## [1] &quot;Aruba&quot; ## [2] &quot;Anguilla&quot; ## [3] &quot;Aland&quot; ## ... (49 countries omitted for brevity) ## [53] &quot;United States of America&quot; ## [54] &quot;Vatican&quot; ## [55] &quot;British Virgin Islands&quot; ## [56] &quot;United States Virgin Islands&quot; ## [57] &quot;Wallis and Futuna&quot; This gives us a list of only the countries in the Earth data set that were not matched. Here we see that, for instance, \"United States of America\" was not matched to the COVID-19 data, even though we know there were large number of cases in the US. The next step is to see how this country is called in the other data set. Again, you could just look at all the names in the variable countries, but how about we only check countries which name contains a capital letter U: # Countries in the COVID-19 data set with a capital letter U countries[grep(&quot;U&quot;, countries)] ## [1] &quot;United Arab Emirates&quot; &quot;United Kingdom&quot; ## [3] &quot;Uganda&quot; &quot;Ukraine&quot; ## [5] &quot;Uruguay&quot; &quot;United States of America&quot; ## [7] &quot;Uzbekistan&quot; &quot;Virgin Islands, U.S.&quot; # Countries in the Earth data set with a capital letter U Earth$admin[grep(&quot;U&quot;, Earth$admin)] ## [1] &quot;United Arab Emirates&quot; &quot;United Kingdom&quot; ## [3] &quot;United Republic of Tanzania&quot; &quot;Uganda&quot; ## [5] &quot;Ukraine&quot; &quot;Uruguay&quot; ## [7] &quot;United States of America&quot; &quot;Uzbekistan&quot; ## [9] &quot;United States Virgin Islands&quot; Here we see the problem: In the COVID-19 data set, the US is called \"United States\", whereas in the Earth data set it is called \"United States of America\". (In the original script, I already changed this for the United States, South Korea and the Ivory Coast.) The solution is to overwrite the name so they are both the same: countries[countries == &quot;United States&quot;] &lt;- &quot;United States of America&quot; And like that, you can check all the unmatched countries for perhaps other names they might be known by. Here is another example: # Countries containing &quot;Congo&quot; in the COVID-19 data set countries[grep(&quot;Congo&quot;, countries)] ## [1] &quot;Congo, the Democratic Republic of the&quot; ## [2] &quot;Congo&quot; # Countries containing &quot;Congo&quot; in the Earth data set Earth$admin[grep(&quot;Congo&quot;, Earth$admin)] ## [1] &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot; &quot;Republic of Congo&quot; 4.3.3 Exercise (medium) As you can see above, the two Congos have different names in either data set. Read the original script carefully. Add what you think is necessary to color the two Congos as well. To see if it works, simply run the script again to produce the (new) figure. Using the method described above, can you color any other countries which are now grey? (Hint: Some countries do not have any data on confirmed cases, like Turkmenistan and North Korea. You can leave these uncolored.) 4.3.4 Exercise (hard) Adjust the script to draw the number of coronavirus cases on a given day, relative to the population size of each country, and then adjust the plot to zoom in on the continent of Asia.

Note: This is a copy of the chapter from General Research Skills and serves as a placeholder. This pages content is subject to change. 11.1 Introduction Principal Component Analysis, or PCA in short, is a dimension reduction method or unsupervised machine learning method in modern statistical language. PCA is an exploratory method and need to be contrasted with conformational methods like the methods discussed in the previous two weeks, and prediction methods, that are not discussed in this course. Exploratory methods are used when there is no clear enough understanding of our system of interest to generate an meaningful hypothesis; a hypothesis for conformational statistics. One example is the measurement of many morphological or genetic features of different Species within a genus. The dataset is than explored to identify those features that that can be used to classify or reltaed species to each other. Now imagine a spreadsheet with individual subjects as rows and features or properties as columns. An example could be a dataset within each row an ID representing an individual, followed by 250 features measured on that individual; in the context of dimension reduction (PCA) this dataset contains 250 dimensions. Its clear that we cannot visualize 250 dimensions effectively in order to explore the dataset, at least not as in the case of a two dimensional setting (x,y) used in the previous weeks. As a dimension reduction method, PCA reduces the dimensions of the problem, 250 dimensions in our example, to a two dimensional space that can be represent in a x,y plot that we can investigate on paper (and also the flat computer screen). In doing so it tries to extract the maximal amount of information from the higher dimensional space and concentrate it in two dimensions. Information used to accomplish this takes the following statistics measures, Variance: If a variable (dimensions) varies a lot in you data, it means that its dimension has discriminating properties and caries information. The opposite, no variation, would mean that the property is shared by all individuals and no groups of individuals can be singled out, therefore this dimension would not carry any information. Correlation: If variables (dimensions) vary, then they can correlate. If features are correlated, then we might expect that there is some morphological or functional relations and that feature therefore caries information. We shall work out these ideas in the following screencasts. The fundamentals of PCA are however, based on linear algebra which is unfortunately outside the scoop of this course. Therefore we will take a more intuitive approach in the screencasts, using the concepts introduced in the previous two weeks, the aforementioned variance and correlations. 11.2 Motivation behind PCA This screencast explains the basic motivation behind dimensions reduction PCA. First the explanation behind the dimension reduction of a 3D object into 2D. It also addresses the meaning of the modern classification of PCA as an unsupervised machine learning methodology by comparing it with supervised machine learning. As an simple example the Iris data is used. This data set will we analyzed in more detail in another screencast. Questions: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning methodologies. 11.3 PCA fundamentals PCA algorithm is solidly based on linear algebra. Without going in to detail we will use a concept and two measures from linear algebra: Orthogonality: Dimensions (variables) are independent of each other if they are Orthogonal; geometrically we would visualize that as perpendicular dimensions (axes). Eigenvectors: The directions of these orthogonal axes, and thus the principal components, are given by the eigenvectors. Eigenvalues: The length, or weights, of the eigenvectors are given by the eigenvalues. It turns out that the eigenvalues are directly related to the variance of the principle component. PCA captures the most variance in the first new axes, the first principal component, by capturing most of the information (variance or eigenvalues). This is repeated for the next orthogonal principal component by capturing the most information (variance or eigenvalue) that is left after the previous step. These steps are repeated until we have the same number of principle components as dimensions. How we need to interpret the loading of a variables in a principal component? 11.4 PCA in classification In this simple example the Iris data, introduced earlier, are analyzed using PCA. Note that normally we do not have the information on which species the individuals belong to, unsupervised. The species are only used here for a didactic purpose. Questions: Which of the Sepal or Petal width and lengths were important in the first and which in the second principal component? Which feature(s) (variable(s)) is response for the separation between Versicolor and Virginica? 11.5 PCA and gradients The Heptathlon dataset give the scores, for every athlete, for the different disciplines of the womans Olympic Heptathlon of 1988 in Seoul. The row are the individual athletes and the columns the scores per discipline. This dataset might be interesting for the coaches to investigate if one of disciplines might contribute more to a success than another. Here we do not look in particular to clusters of groups of athletes but if the distribution of the individual athlete is related to the final score when visualizing the principal components. The relation with linear regression and supervised learning is also discussed. Question Explain in your own words which disciplines contributed to the success of Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
