This page contains all the videos from \\(t\\)-test to ANOVA, to simple linear regression and ANCOVA. You do not have to watch them, they are here as reference material. At the end there are questions about choosing the right method. 5.1 T-Test A test for comparing two group means. The data-generating process is assumed to follow a normal distribution, given the group. 5.1.1 Choosing the right \\(t\\)-test 5.1.2 Understanding how the \\(t\\)-test works 5.2 Chi-Squared Test A test for comparing observed to expected frequencies (counts). Can also be used for contingency tables. 5.3 ANOVA A model for comparing any number of group means. The data-generating process is assumed to follow a normal distribution, given the group. 5.3.1 One-way ANOVA 5.3.2 How does it work? 5.3.3 Two-way, multi-way, interaction 5.4 Simple linear regression A model for a continuous response variable and a continuous explanatory variable, between which a linear relationship is assumed. The data-generating process is assumed to follow a normal distribution, given the effect of the explanatory variable. (Part 2 is still under construction, if you have any questions about how linear regression works, Harald and I are more then happy to elaborate during the lectures.) 5.5 ANCOVA ANCOVA is multiple linear regression with both categorical and continuous explanatory variables. 5.6 Exercises Download the exercises here and the required data sets here. (If you cant knit, click here for a PDF version of the exercises.) Everything is already in tidy format. The exercises are described in the linked file. The methods you need could be any of the above, or a GLM. If you dont know what a GLM is, just solve the problems how you think is correct. "]]
